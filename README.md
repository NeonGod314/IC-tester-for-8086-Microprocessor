# IC-tester-for-8086-Microprocessor
Simulation of IC tester constructed from 8086 Microprocessor to test the functioning of IC 7400, 7402 and 7410

In this project a system was designed using the 8086 microprocessor,MUXes, DMUXesxes, Timers, EPROM and RAM chips to test the ICs 7400, 7402 and 7410. 
This project was also simulated on Proteus software. The Microprocessor was programmed in Assembly Language. The Project was completed successfully.
